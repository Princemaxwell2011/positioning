            Robotics is the intersection of science, engineering and technology that produces machines, called robots, that
            replicate or substitute for human actions.

                A robot is a programmable machine that can complete a task, while the term robotics describes the field of study focused
                on developing robots and automation. Each robot has a different level of autonomy. These levels range from
                human-controlled bots that carry out tasks to fully-autonomous bots that perform tasks without any external influences.

                <h2>Hello Mr Bramuel lets test sticky</h2>
                <p>In terms of etymology, the word ‘robot’ is derived from the Czech word robota, which means “forced labor.” The word
                first appeared in the 1920 play R.U.R., in reference to the play’s characters who were mass-produced workers incapable
                of creative thinking.</p>
            </section>
            <p>Robotics is an interdisciplinary sector of science and engineering dedicated to the design, construction and use of
            mechanical robots. Our guide will give you a concrete grasp of robotics, including different types of robots and how
            they’re being applied across industries</p>

                    Robotics Aspects
                    
                    Mechanical Construction
                    The mechanical aspect of a robot helps it complete tasks in the environment for which it’s designed. For example, the
                    Mars 2020 Rover’s wheels are individually motorized and made of titanium tubing that help it firmly grip the harsh
                    terrain of the red planet.
                    
                    Electrical Components
                    Robots need electrical components that control and power the machinery. Essentially, an electric current — a battery,
                    for example — is needed to power a large majority of robots.
                    
                    Software Program
                    Robots contain at least some level of computer programming. Without a set of code telling it what to do, a robot would
                    just be another piece of simple machinery. Inserting a program into a robot gives it the ability to know when and how to
                    carry out a task.
                    
                    
                    
                    What Are the Main Components of a Robot?
                    
                    Control System
                    Computation includes all of the components that make up a robot’s central processing unit, often referred to as its
                    control system. Control systems are programmed to tell a robot how to utilize its specific components, similar in some
                    ways to how the human brain sends signals throughout the body, in order to complete a specific task. These robotic tasks
                    could comprise anything from minimally invasive surgery to assembly line packing.
                    
                    Sensors
                    Sensors provide a robot with stimuli in the form of electrical signals that are processed by the controller and allow
                    the robot to interact with the outside world. Common sensors found within robots include video cameras that function as
                    eyes, photoresistors that react to light and microphones that operate like ears. These sensors allow the robot to
                    capture its surroundings and process the most logical conclusion based on the current moment and allows the controller
                    to relay commands to the additional components.
                    
                    Actuators
                    A device can only be considered to be a robot if it has a movable frame or body. Actuators are the components that are
                    responsible for this movement. These components are made up of motors that receive signals from the control system and
                    move in tandem to carry out the movement necessary to complete the assigned task. Actuators can be made of a variety of
                    materials, such as metal or elastic, and are commonly operated by use of compressed air (pneumatic actuators) or oil
                    (hydraulic actuators) but come in a variety of formats to best fulfill their specialized roles.
                    
                    Power Supply
                    Like the human body requires food in order to function, robots require power. Stationary robots, such as those found in
                    a factory, may run on AC power through a wall outlet but more commonly, robots operate via an internal battery. Most
                    robots utilize lead-acid batteries for their safe qualities and long shelf life while others may utilize the more
                    compact but also more expensive silver-cadmium variety. Safety, weight, replaceability and lifecycle are all important
                    factors to consider when designing a robot’s power supply.
                    
                    Some potential power sources for future robotic development also include pneumatic power from compressed gasses, solar
                    power, hydraulic power, flywheel energy storage organic garbage through anaerobic digestion and nuclear power.
                    
                    End Effectors
                    End effectors are the physical, typically external components that allow robots to finish carrying out their tasks.
                    Robots in factories often have interchangeable tools like paint sprayers and drills, surgical robots may be equipped
                    with scalpels and other kinds of robots can be built with gripping claws or even hands for tasks like deliveries,
                    packing, bomb diffusion and much more
